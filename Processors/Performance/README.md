[Which online CPU benchmarks produce the more valid results relative to a real usage scenario? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-online-CPU-benchmarks-produce-the-more-valid-results-relative-to-a-real-usage-scenario)
> Some benchmarks like UserBenchmark are unreliable because their testing algorithm is geared towards one brand over another. Geekbench has a bias towards ARM processors. Most other benchmarks like Cinebench or CPU-Z only track all-cores or one core.
>
> The other problem is a given CPU like the Ryzen 7 7800x3d will excel in one type of workload but it will fall behind other processors in another….. or another processors like the i9–13900k or Ryzen 7950x will excel in thread heavy workloads, but won’t be much better than cheaper processors in workloads that use a limited number of threads.
> 
> The best thing to do is and almost always will be to look up benchmarks that feature the programs you want to use.

[More GHz or cores : r/buildapc](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/vun2rn/more_ghz_or_cores/)
> more cores only matters if what you're using the PC needs more cores. Games prefer enough cores (6c12t) that are fast while video editing and 3d rendering likes more cores even if they're slower
