# Graphics Processing Unit
[^wiki]

A **graphics processing unit (GPU)** is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device

It is becoming increasingly common to use a **general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)** as a modified form of stream processor (or a vector processor), running compute kernels.
